Week 2 code challenge solution

This repository includes the solution to a coding challenge in which I had to create an application that was unable to accept user input.
The program uses HTML to render the contents to the browser, JavaScript for interactivity, and CSS for styling.
The user has the ability to write a list of items, mark those that they have purchased and will be struck through, and change items.
The user also has the option to delete things from the list.
All that this straightforward app does for customers is make their shopping list easily accessible and manageable.
